# Purpose
The app's purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data


## Marketing Research Team 

Kim is a marketing researcher who wants to have an unbiased approach to deciding what items are to be advertized in the Bus Mall magazine on buses. Kim decides that we need at least 25 rounds of focus group participation before assessing the results. 

Mac is another marking researcher who hones in on the goals of the focus group trials; Mac wants to count the number of clicks (i.e. trails), just like Kim. Additionally, however, Mac is interested in tracking the percentage of times that a given image was clicked. This means that the app needs to track the number of times each image is displayed. 

Both researchers would like to graph the number of clicks for each item and the number of times shown for each item. 



## Participants 

Sammie is a teenager without delayed gratification. They're interested in items that elicit dopamine rushes. They want something with an easily-understood user interface that will show the graphical results in an approachable way at the end. 

Tammie has a background in marketing and wants to see items presented in an ubiased way: randomly and in random locations. They're hoping that bus mall will present them with interesting items that can be accessed by their images without additional information for now.
